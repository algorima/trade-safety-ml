I was mainly curious on whether I should buy directly off the site or off Delivered Korea, since I've seen both options and they send me to different checkout pages. Does anyone have experience with buying off Bunjang Global and know if it's safe? A step-by-step guide would be helpful but i haven't been able to find anything. 

How do I know that an item I'm purchasing (i.e. if it has multiple options and I have no way to choose one; the only option is add to cart) is the correct one? Is it similar to a proxy service? I also don't live in the US so I'm ready to pay in USD and for that to be converted into my currency.

1jh291n,Torn on selling ult pcs/albums,Dry-Statement-2146,,,,discussion,5.0,10.0,"So I've been a kpop fan since 2017 and, within the past few years, predominantly a Seventeen and Monsta X ult, with other groups/soloists I'm a fan of. Over the years I've collected quite a few albums, PCs, and other goodies in general, all of which have unfortunately just sat on my shelves since purchasing.

I'm looking to downsize a lot within this year, as I'm planning to move in with my partner and so want to save myself the hassle of packing and unpacking more stuff than I need.

I've already posted duplicate albums and other miscellaneous items online but I am particularly torn over selling albums and PCs related to either SVT or MX. 

I'm torn over selling each of the versions of their various albums that I had originally planned to keep but now that I'm thinking of it, I'm leaning heavily to not keeping them.

I'm torn in particular over selling Kihyun's Voyager albums, unopened, as he's my ult. I'm torn over selling PCs of S.Coups or Hoshi or DK, but especially Hoshi, as he's also my ult.

I guess what I'm looking for is your input and any tips or advice? I need the extra cash, as I'm sure a lot of us do, but there's just something a little sad about selling this stuff to me. It feels... not quite wrong but something I'm reluctant to do, even if I know it'll be best all around, especially since I know someone else would love and appreciate these items.
