But i am having trouble with selling my collection I even started a Buy 2 get 1 free sale for ALL stray kids sells on my Instagram hoping to catch peoples eyes. I have a price posted but I try to make it clear it is 100% negotiable at reasonable prices. I even plan on doing bi weekly 10-50% off sales to hopefully get people to buy my collection. Its difficult because I currently am not working rat the moment and I still need to take care of myself and my family. So money is unfortunately very much needed right now.
