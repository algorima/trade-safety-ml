1p22hnk,"Mail lost after trade, should I pay them for their half?",Friendly-Hedgehog215,,,,Question,23,23,"Hi! Sorry if this is the wrong sub but I was hoping y'all had some BST advice since we're all collectors! 

TL;DR: I sent out my half of a trade first but it seems like seller hasn't received it. Does this mean I have to pay them to receive my half? I would prefer not to since seller has shown me attitude.

About a month ago I arranged a trade for my PC + $5 with someone for two PCs from a GO she was hosting. She almost aggressively insisted I send my PC first and I did since I have less proofs. After that, she briefly deactivated, reactivated, had an angry conversation with me but said the trade was still on.

It’s now been about 3 weeks since I mailed my PC, and she still hasn’t received it. She also told me not to DM her for updates related to the GO because of the argument. At this point I’m assuming my PC is lost.

So my question is what happens now? I know lost mail is no one's fault but she asked me to and I did send out first in case of this situation happening. 

Should I still offer 3 dollars? I'd rather not because of how she acted but I don't know what the right step is?

Also! Making a DWAYOR is not an option. My friend tried and people were overwhelmingly on the seller's side since she's prominent in the BST community. I also don't want to start unnecessary drama again, I just want my PCs 😿",2025-11-20 21:58:06,https://reddit.com/r/kpopcollections/comments/1p22hnk/mail_lost_after_trade_should_i_pay_them_for_their/,,False,2025-12-14 14:38:41,,관련x,,,labeling_시영님_20개.xlsx

1ozfnsm,Weekly Photocard Verification Thread,AutoModerator,,,,Weekly Verification,3,5,"Post in this thread to get help with your purchases!  **Please include pictures of the front and back of the card, as  well as what album/merch it's from. If it's a POB, include the store  that it came from (Apple Music/Makestar/Ktown4u etc). You can skip this  information if you don't know where the card is from, but it will make  it a lot easier for me/others to search for the card. It also helps to  include where you bought from/where you will be buying from to determine  if the card is legit.** 

**Some things to keep in mind:**



* Cards with a general value of $10 or under are unlikely to be fake.
* Cards from albums that are still in print are unlikely to be fake. Difference in card thickness/tab location/finish doesn't always mean a card is fake, because different manufacturers can be used every reprint.
* Some groups use the same picture in different ways for multiple pre-order benefits, so it being cropped doesn't necessarily mean it's  fake. Dreamcatcher used to do this and I believe all SM groups do this for their Season's Greetings pre-order benefits.
* First round preorder benefits from KTOWN4U and MAKESTAR for popular groups are less likely to be fake, especially if the general value is under $10.
* Albums with promo stickers are less likely to be fake, though do keep in mind that some idols have their managers sign the albums for them (this is common for SM groups if I recall correctly).
* Artists signatures generally evolve throughout the years, just because it doesn't look the same as a near debut signature doesn't mean it's fake.

**Scams to look out for:**

Mercari Japan has had a big upswing of fake rare cards. Thankfully, they don't put much effort into making their listings look 'legit' so it's pretty obvious if you don't just impulse buy. [Here is an example.](https://jp.mercari.com/user/profile/775453423) Only 7 sales (at time of writing), rare cards from every big group, and the card quality looks terrible.

Signed cards weren't always common. Some groups like Twice did not sign cards at all really before recent site specific pre-order benefits and lucky draws. [Here is an example of a fake signed card.](https://jp.mercari.com/item/m86467692986)  If you click through to their profile you can see they somehow managed to find 100s of these signed cards ""from other websites"" and once again,  they are all from the most popular groups.

These random signed stage photos with a ""Hollywood Style Inc Certificate of Authenticity"". I can't confirm that all signed stage photos are fake, but legit ones are rare enough that I would be extra wary when buying.

If the album is signed by more than one member, check if the pen pressure looks the same on each signature.

**Resources to help you verify:**

Youtube - You can look up unboxing videos of other's fansign albums to see preorder benefits and member signatures. 

Instagram - Same thing as above. A lot of people post pictures/clips of their preorder benefits and fansign albums. Collection photos often show off these as well. There are also some accounts that have guides on  member signatures.

Twitter - There are accounts that scan photocards which could help you verify proper level of zoom if you worry a card is cropped etc.

Ebay - Search for past sales for comparison of prices and product photos.",2025-11-17 22:01:30,https://reddit.com/r/kpopcollections/comments/1ozfnsm/weekly_photocard_verification_thread/,,False,2025-12-14 14:38:41,,관련x,,,labeling_시영님_20개.xlsx
1nhq62r,How do you decide what merchandise to sell versus keep when needing concert funds? Or what merch to prioritize when concerts are approaching?,jiminjimintoes,,,,Question,3,9,"I am getting a little antsy now that Namjoon confirmed that BTS would be touring next year. Like financially antsy and stressed. BTS has always been the only group I’ve followed and loved, so I must see them (assuming I get tickets but you get the idea).

I am just wondering how I should weigh the pros and cons of buying merch and photocards that I’ve wanted for some time when a new album and tour is amongst us! 

How do you all choose what is priority? 

Or how do you choose which merchandise to sell for the money to go towards concerts, or which merchandise to keep as you still love it enough to keep and not sell for quick money? 

For example, I have a lot of Park Jihoon PCs and Jihyo from Twice PCs. I love them both a LOT and would hate to sell the cards and merch, but when weighing against my NEED to see BTS live, I suppose I should sell the items... But it hurts to sell them all because I do enjoy them. How do you guys choose which deserves to be sold and which deserves to be kept? 

Just wanting some advice, thanks!",2025-09-16 1:11:57,https://reddit.com/r/kpopcollections/comments/1nhq62r/how_do_you_decide_what_merchandise_to_sell_versus/,,False,2025-12-14 14:38:58,,관련x,,,labeling_시영님_20개.xlsx

1peegra,Coloursim within NCT and how they respond to it,127ncity127,resident of “fatigued fandom”,,,Discussion,98,91,"I'd like to think as a fandom we have gotten better at acknowledging the many mistakes NCT has made with regards to racism, CA, colorism, weight, etc.

I tend to see nctzens not attempt to brush it under the rug. As a collective we have done better than other fandoms at acknowledging how the Neos have really messed up in the past

But something that has still disappointed me is how often the Neos talk about color. I won't go into past transgressions and will only talk about stuff that happened this year because to me, its still frustrating that this topic is brought up, even if its in a joking manner or someone is being praised for their ""tan"" skin

After Jungwoos Italy and Hawaii trip, illichill made a few passing comments on how tan Jungwoo got. Though they were all said in a ""loving"" manner, telling Jungwoo how ""charming"" his tan looks, it's still strange to me that that was such a prevalent conversation starter. Jungwoo mentioned it himself on Nopogy and other content.

I don't follow Wish closely but I know his skin color was remarked on by other members too, even in comparison to Jungwoo

and now, a video clip has gone viral of Renjun interrupting Dreams cb live just to point out how different his skin color is to Chenle. (and with Chenle, ive seen multiple times now members talk about how his skin is so ""pure white""...)

at least Mark lightly called Renjun out for the comment once things got awkward. I would even say he kind of reprimanded him for the comment. And Jaemin tried to teasingly call him out before they shifted the topic.

SM edited this out Renjuns remark when they re-uploaded the content, so it seems they have learned from Shinees incident last year

Im Asian, so I know talking about color is normal in our culture, but as a darker skinned Asian, it still is frustrating how normalized this is.

I think we're making small improvements (it's not lost on me that years ago everyone would be talking about how ""Dark"" Jungwoo got or how everyone would have laughed at the Haechan ""joke"".)

Anyways, I just wish this still wasn't something the Neos talked about so casually and I hope NCTzens don't try and brush this off or use this for fanwars

Talking about the ""ugly"" is helpful and will help to not normalize this behavior. That much is apparent by SM's attempt to edit out the clip and how the Neos have tried to correct their own behavior, even if they still sometimes regress into childish remarks",2025-12-05 7:51:42,https://reddit.com/r/NCT/comments/1peegra/coloursim_within_nct_and_how_they_respond_to_it/,,False,2025-12-14 14:43:18,,판매 및 구매글 아님,,,labeling_지영님_20개.xlsx

1ph6d7i,My VR Concert Experience,XythniaStar,🤘🏾FIX ON!🤘🏾 -  🐥🐿️⭐🏔️🦊🐶👑🐻,,,Discussion,230,51,"So I caught the Light the Way VR concert tonight at a theater in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, USA.  This is my take on the whole experience.

And WARNING - I write very detailed, very LONG ass reviews. 😁 💤 💀 

**tl;dr** - It was freaking amazing. Easily worth the $50 ticket price + the drive into the city. Highly recommend.


🎟️ **ARRIVAL** 🎟️

Light the Way was VERY well put together, in organization, tech, and the script/flow of the concert itself.  The theater had a separate ticket check-in, which I was quickly directed to.  The lovely ladies staffing the check-in provided the hygiene mask, poster, physical ticket and random photo card (image attached). They then warned me that only popcorn and (I forget) are allowed in as NO sticky residue can get on the units.  However, I recommend no food/drink except water. Trust that you might get overheated and need the water. 😂 

Once you head to your theater room, if it's not exactly 10 mins before your showing, you will wait outside until the attendant opens the doors.  Which was fine - I arrived with 20 mins to spare and was immediately asked who my bias and commenced chatting with the girls waiting ahead of me. I love extroverts. 😍

My showing (7pm on a Sunday night) was decently filled - I'd say about 60 folks, mostly in the twenties to thirties range, with a few exceptions like myself (but no younger kiddos).

The theater itself was a standard, medium sized, stadium setup.   You are led to a seat and instructed to fill in by the attendants.  There is no assigned seating (and placement really doesn't matter) but stay with your group and you'll be seated with them. I was solo and my row was filled except the end seat next to me.  They saved it to fill it with another solo, who came in after the initial seating (I greeted her and we ended up chatting as well).

Once seated, you won't touch anything until instructed.  However, a charging cable for the headsets were lined up the back of your seat, and the VR Headset (similar to the Meta Oculus) was in a pouch on the seat in front of you. A walk thru of how to get the cable, plug it into the headset, put on the hygiene mask, (then your glasses), then the headset will be played on the big screen, with the attendants at the ready to help out.

Shout-out to the attendants!  They were helpful, friendly, AND part of the fandom (which was great for making everyone feel comfortable, little interactions and ensuring they themselves don't go insane). For example, they waited to begin until the MV (I think it was Work) finished on the big screen because most of us were singing along. 🫰🏾

As for the show itself...

🎬 **THE VR CONCERT** 🎬

You WILL have a VR Light stick.  I barely used it.  You WILL get to choose a 'main character' of sorts.  This part is fun...very fighting game character selection screen. Pick from one of the 8 and he'll be displayed.  You have an onscreen countdown so you can flip thru each before making your final selection. Will it be your bias?  Will it be your wrecker?  Whoever you choose hose, It basically customizes a few (maybe 4?) short, mini-scenes, with that person. At least one of these moment is very up close, and personal.  My bias is Mingi. I obviously chose Mingi. I was NOT disappointed. 🫠

It then goes into the sync'd show...which is like a mix of a VR movie/game scenes and then the guys performing songs with full choreography and outfit changes.  I think the sound is coming from the theater sound system and it was excellent (it was an IMAX theater so possibly dolby sound).  So we're all experiencing the same thing, at the same time (except you see whoever you selected in your solo scenes).  All while you feel like your seated on a floating chair that slowly moves towards, away, above, and slightly below them.

I cannot understate how fully immersed and stupidly CLOSE you will feel to them. There were moments where I am positive that if I took my headset off, I would have seen people with their hands up trying to touch the face (or chest 😏) of whoever they were seeing in front of them. They put you in the middle of the choreo. They put you slightly to the ground, looking up at them.  They put them right below you. They occasionally jump scare you coming from off the sides.  It's ridiculous how well mapped out it all is!

I have used VR since the original Oculus Rift Dev Kit. I own an Oculus Quest now (Beat Saber ftw!). I say all this to express how NOT novel VR is for me.  But my nearly 50yo ass STILL freaking SQUEALED right out the gate when Mingi was RIGHT in front of me.  And when Hongjoong winked right in front of me. And when San body rolled/pelvic thrusted RIGHT in front of me.  Like...SHESH!  But EVERYONE squeals at the same time, so it was fine, it was fine. 😂 


⚠️ **RECOMMENDATIONS &amp; WARNINGS** ⚠️

⭐ If you wear glasses, you should still be just fine.  Take your time putting the headset on so it's snug but comfortable. Interestingly, with my own unit I had to adjust the field depth. This was good without fiddling with it so it's either doing something automatically or I got lucky.  But if you feel ""weird"" after a few moments, ask for help.

⭐ If you are prone to motion sickness I highly recommend popping a Ginger Dramamine (or grabbing some Ginger Chews candy) 30-45mins before the showtime. You WILL ""feel"" the movement when using a VR unit like these. There was one woman, closer to my age who (while trying to trade her photo card at the end of the concert) mentioned she ""didn't like"" the experience.

⭐ It might get sweaty with the unit on.  I didn't, but I caught comments about it from others. I also think some girls just needed water from too much ""immersion"". 😂 

⭐ Yes,.you will hear other people.  Singing, cheering, clapping, squealing.  A few 'OMG OMG HE'S TOO CLOSE!' and 'Stop looking into my soul, Yeosang!', at the beginning especially.  It's nothing bad, all part of the fun, and it didn't distract or detract from my experience at all (and my nonsense tolerance is LOW).  I sang a little, clapped and cheers after songs ended, squealed and freaked out a bit when they were TOO close.  It's great. 😂 

⭐ The VR Light stick. Kinda worthless to me because WHY would you want to BLOCK your view of these talented, gorgeous men??? It's NOT like a concert where they are 500 ft from you. This is like they are giving you a private show in a small room, dancing practically in your lap!

However, if you DO choose to use the VR stick...

⚠️ *KEEP YOUR HANDS INSIDE YOUR OWN SEAT AREA!* ⚠️ 

The VR units track movement. A couple of times my solo seat neighbor kind of flailed her arms out into my area, which MY device picked up on and it created a light tear effect on my screen. It was trying to load MY ""light stick"" because of HER hand.  Annoying, understandable, and it thankfully only happened twice (I was about to softly take her hand and tell her what was happening but she chilled - must have been freaking out during some up close moment 😆).

⭐ DO raise your hand if your experiencing any discomfort, tech issues,.just want to make it tighter/looser, etc.  The attendants are keeping an eye out and WANT to make this a good experience for us all.  If you need a break, take it!  I took my unit off for a sec just to reposition my hygiene mask. 


🎶 **THE SETLIST** 🎶

Song 1 : INCEPTION
Song 2 : Wake Up
Song 3 : MIST
Song 4 : Cyberpunk
Song 5 : Deja Vu - Special VR Concert Version!
Song 6 : Ice On My Teeth
-Closing-
Encore : Bouncy (K-hot Chilli Peppers)

Personally, Wake Up and Cyberpunk were my favs. But they are two of my favorite Ateez songs so that's no surprise. But the choreo, eye contact, faces during each song - UGH...so good. 


🏁 FINAL VERDICT 🏁
It's only about...40 mins maybe?  It says an hour but at least 10 mins is setup.  

But was it worth it?  

If you're even a passing fan of ATEEZ (or whatever artist is using the VR concert tech) then ABSOLUTELY.  It's VERY up close and personal.  Like...shesh. 😆 Plus it was fun meeting other fans, chatting about biases, trading photo cards, and having the shared live experience.

To my fellow ""omg, maybe I'm too old for this"" folks...pfft - please.  I am about double the average age for this and still felt very included while having a blast. And I had to ignore my youngest half-ass making fun of me for going (it's the VR Concert part she thinks is weird/lame - but if Lana del Rey had this then she'd come running 😂).

To my fellow solos who are nervous about going alone.  Seriously, just go.  Kpop fans are ridiculously friendly (see my post on going to the Monsta X: Connect X movie concert this week!).  Ask the person next to you who their bias is, what song they hope is on the playlist, or if this is their first time at a VR concert.  Ice broken...if they don't ask you first! 😊 

No one cares at ALL about any of that. It's all the shared experience of enjoying these talented, beautiful, ridiculous men and their amazing music.

🤘🏾 **FIX ON!** 🤘🏾

1nhjw2l,Weekly Photocard Verification Thread,AutoModerator,,,,Weekly Verification,6,2,"Post in this thread to get help with your purchases!  **Please include pictures of the front and back of the card, as  well as what album/merch it's from. If it's a POB, include the store  that it came from (Apple Music/Makestar/Ktown4u etc). You can skip this  information if you don't know where the card is from, but it will make  it a lot easier for me/others to search for the card. It also helps to  include where you bought from/where you will be buying from to determine  if the card is legit.** 

**Some things to keep in mind:**



* Cards with a general value of $10 or under are unlikely to be fake.
* Cards from albums that are still in print are unlikely to be fake. Difference in card thickness/tab location/finish doesn't always mean a card is fake, because different manufacturers can be used every reprint.
* Some groups use the same picture in different ways for multiple pre-order benefits, so it being cropped doesn't necessarily mean it's  fake. Dreamcatcher used to do this and I believe all SM groups do this for their Season's Greetings pre-order benefits.
* First round preorder benefits from KTOWN4U and MAKESTAR for popular groups are less likely to be fake, especially if the general value is under $10.
* Albums with promo stickers are less likely to be fake, though do keep in mind that some idols have their managers sign the albums for them (this is common for SM groups if I recall correctly).
* Artists signatures generally evolve throughout the years, just because it doesn't look the same as a near debut signature doesn't mean it's fake.

**Scams to look out for:**

Mercari Japan has had a big upswing of fake rare cards. Thankfully, they don't put much effort into making their listings look 'legit' so it's pretty obvious if you don't just impulse buy. [Here is an example.](https://jp.mercari.com/user/profile/775453423) Only 7 sales (at time of writing), rare cards from every big group, and the card quality looks terrible.

Signed cards weren't always common. Some groups like Twice did not sign cards at all really before recent site specific pre-order benefits and lucky draws. [Here is an example of a fake signed card.](https://jp.mercari.com/item/m86467692986)  If you click through to their profile you can see they somehow managed to find 100s of these signed cards ""from other websites"" and once again,  they are all from the most popular groups.

These random signed stage photos with a ""Hollywood Style Inc Certificate of Authenticity"". I can't confirm that all signed stage photos are fake, but legit ones are rare enough that I would be extra wary when buying.

If the album is signed by more than one member, check if the pen pressure looks the same on each signature.

**Resources to help you verify:**

Youtube - You can look up unboxing videos of other's fansign albums to see preorder benefits and member signatures. 

Instagram - Same thing as above. A lot of people post pictures/clips of their preorder benefits and fansign albums. Collection photos often show off these as well. There are also some accounts that have guides on  member signatures.

Twitter - There are accounts that scan photocards which could help you verify proper level of zoom if you worry a card is cropped etc.

Ebay - Search for past sales for comparison of prices and product photos.",2025-09-15 21:01:18,https://reddit.com/r/kpopcollections/comments/1nhjw2l/weekly_photocard_verification_thread/,,False,2025-12-14 14:38:58,,포토카드 거래 주의사항 정리 글,송은재,2025-12-17 00:00:00,labeling_은재님_20개.xlsx

1peqvfs,Did you keep anything from your collection before selling?,Ok_Sound_6713,,,,Question,40,8,"For anybody that has sold a lot/most (if not all) of their collection, is there anything that you kept for sentimental value?

I recently moved to a different country and when I return to my home in a few months to finish sorting through my things, I have to get rid/sell everything as I cannot literally take everything with me. My heart also hasn’t been into collecting for a long time now, so I feel like now is the time. It just began to feel like a chore to keep up with albums and pc collections so I stopped trading/buying around the beginning of 2025. 

Around March, I sold most of my pcs from my various groups as I had then finally felt ready to let them go, but of course I still kept some because they held sentimental value to me at the time.

When I return, I want to sell the rest of my photocards (mostly they were just expensive ones that had taken me forever to find/save up to buy), lightsticks, and signed pieces. But the thought of selling all of it makes me a little sad, however, it’s time for me to let it go. I want to use this money towards buying a nice gift for my partner, so letting it go would be getting put towards something of equal sentimental value for me.

My question is: is there anything that you could never get rid of from your sold/soon to be sold collection? Like a signed album or lightstick or did you just get rid of it ALL? Just curious as to what other people have done! I’ll probably keep a couple signed albums because I do still love those groups :)

1n5mtts,Weekly Photocard Verification Thread,AutoModerator,,,,Weekly Verification,5,8,"Post in this thread to get help with your purchases!  **Please include pictures of the front and back of the card, as  well as what album/merch it's from. If it's a POB, include the store  that it came from (Apple Music/Makestar/Ktown4u etc). You can skip this  information if you don't know where the card is from, but it will make  it a lot easier for me/others to search for the card. It also helps to  include where you bought from/where you will be buying from to determine  if the card is legit.** 

**Some things to keep in mind:**



* Cards with a general value of $10 or under are unlikely to be fake.
* Cards from albums that are still in print are unlikely to be fake. Difference in card thickness/tab location/finish doesn't always mean a card is fake, because different manufacturers can be used every reprint.
* Some groups use the same picture in different ways for multiple pre-order benefits, so it being cropped doesn't necessarily mean it's  fake. Dreamcatcher used to do this and I believe all SM groups do this for their Season's Greetings pre-order benefits.
* First round preorder benefits from KTOWN4U and MAKESTAR for popular groups are less likely to be fake, especially if the general value is under $10.
* Albums with promo stickers are less likely to be fake, though do keep in mind that some idols have their managers sign the albums for them (this is common for SM groups if I recall correctly).
* Artists signatures generally evolve throughout the years, just because it doesn't look the same as a near debut signature doesn't mean it's fake.

**Scams to look out for:**

Mercari Japan has had a big upswing of fake rare cards. Thankfully, they don't put much effort into making their listings look 'legit' so it's pretty obvious if you don't just impulse buy. [Here is an example.](https://jp.mercari.com/user/profile/775453423) Only 7 sales (at time of writing), rare cards from every big group, and the card quality looks terrible.

Signed cards weren't always common. Some groups like Twice did not sign cards at all really before recent site specific pre-order benefits and lucky draws. [Here is an example of a fake signed card.](https://jp.mercari.com/item/m86467692986)  If you click through to their profile you can see they somehow managed to find 100s of these signed cards ""from other websites"" and once again,  they are all from the most popular groups.

These random signed stage photos with a ""Hollywood Style Inc Certificate of Authenticity"". I can't confirm that all signed stage photos are fake, but legit ones are rare enough that I would be extra wary when buying.

If the album is signed by more than one member, check if the pen pressure looks the same on each signature.

**Resources to help you verify:**

Youtube - You can look up unboxing videos of other's fansign albums to see preorder benefits and member signatures. 

Instagram - Same thing as above. A lot of people post pictures/clips of their preorder benefits and fansign albums. Collection photos often show off these as well. There are also some accounts that have guides on  member signatures.

Twitter - There are accounts that scan photocards which could help you verify proper level of zoom if you worry a card is cropped etc.

Ebay - Search for past sales for comparison of prices and product photos.",2025-09-01 21:02:19,https://reddit.com/r/kpopcollections/comments/1n5mtts/weekly_photocard_verification_thread/,,False,2025-12-14 14:39:05,,거래글(flair=Marketplace/Merch/Photocard/Album/Ticket) 아님 → 라벨링 제외,이채현,2025-12-23 00:00:00,labeling_채현님_20개_labeled.xlsx

1pdieni,How is the TWICE concert experience? I need advice for me to know what to expect,Low-Shift8303,,,,Discussion,75,33,"Hello guys, this is going to be my first concert ever and I am really excited that it is going to be a TWICE concert.  

I am just wondering a LOT of things because is not only that this is gonna be my first time, but also I do not seem to find any info about what to do or how the process goes

I was wondering how is your experience or your plan when going to a concert, I am guessing that I should go there PRETTY early for me to see if I can buy some merch before it runs out, but I do not quite know what to expect. 

Should I just go like mabye 5/6 hours early? Because I also bough some general field tickets, and because of that I am guessing that I must get there EARLY to make sure I can be as close as possible because I would LOVE to be right next to the girls and mabye see if I can get some interactions

How does it work if you go THAT early? I do not think that they can just let you get in with food, so I am really curios about if I should really fill my stomach before even thinking about going there, and also there is the fact that I am probabbly not going to be able to go to the bathroom, so any advice on that?

I would also LOVE to have some drinks but I do not think they are going to be selling any type of alcohol in there, should I just bring something with me?

I would love to write something for the girls to see, but I am not sure if I am going to be able to draw anything while waiting in line or if I should have it ready before going there 

Any advice on how to make new friends while I am there?, I get kinda nervous 

Any advice for recording videos? 

Should I go there with a backpack and have everything in there? Although I am more than sure that it is going to be annoying when the concert starts because of being around so many people so idk

I also know that some people leak the positions of the girls in the concert, but is it really that important? 

Obviously it is, but what I mean is more in the sense of is it normally better to choose any specific place to be in for the concert? Taking into consideration that I can pretty much choose freely

Those are the questions that came to my mind and I do not want to give it so much thought right now, but I would love for you to tell me about your experience with any TWICE concert that you have gone 

I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT PLEASE HELP ME LMAO
